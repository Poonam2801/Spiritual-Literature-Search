## Search Architecture

Spiritual Seeker combines two sources for discovery:

- **Curated Catalog (Grounded)**  
  Manually verified spiritual literature with high trust.

- **Google Books (AI-Verified)**  
  Public Google Books results enhanced with spiritual query expansion.

Results are merged using proportional sampling and evaluated by Gemini AI for:
- Spiritual relevance (0–100)
- Confidence tiers
- Grounding status

Catalog results are marked as grounded; external results are clearly differentiated to preserve epistemic trust.
